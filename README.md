A students score management website.

This project completes a simple and common students' grade management system, 
including the relationship among the four objects of courses, students, 
teachers (and teaching assistants), and grades.

The users of the website include administrators, teachers (teaching assistants), 
and students. This project is centered on courses and course grades. Each course 
includes the corresponding department, credits, teachers and other data. 
Students can view the grades each course and total GPA; teachers or teaching assistants 
can view the information and grades of students who selected the courses.

Teachers or teaching assistants can score the ordinary exams or finals, after that, 
students can question their grades and submit applications. Then teachers(or TA) 
can change the scores according to the situation. 

At the end of the semester, students can evaluate and score the teachers' performance.
When students need to drop the course due to special circumstances, they can write 
an application, and the administrator will deal with it according to the content of 
the application. Also the administrator can delete courses or change teachers.
